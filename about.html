	<h2>About Kapistahan</h2>
	<img src="img/restaurant.jpg" width="500px"/>
	<p>
		Founded in 2019, Kapistahan is a Filipino restaurant located in Charlottesville, VA. Fueled by their passion of teaching their Charlottesville community of the Filipino culture, Maria and J.R. de Dios opened up Kapistahan. They began with a slow start but quickly gathered a following after being covered by the University of Virginia's Cavalier Daily newspaper. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		"This is the closest thing I have to my mom's cooking", a U.Va. student wrote. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		"I love their halo halo. I don't think I've ever had anything like it before," a faculty of the Unversity commented.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Kapistahan is known for their sinigang, which is a sour soup that contains a plethora of vegetables and a source of protein. Eaten with a side of rice, this dish is the perfect mix between sour and salty, and it will definitely fill you up with one serving. Kapistahan also sells desserts, like halo halo, and also has Filipino snacks, like Chippy, calamansi juice, and ChocNut.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Through Kapistahan, the de Dios family hopes to provide a home for other Filipino-Americans in Charlottesville as well as teach their neighbors of the rich (and delicious!) Filipino culture.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		As of March 2020, in order to comply with social distancing guidelines, all seating at Kapistahan has been closed, and the restaurant is only open to employees. All customers must order through the order form, which can be found on the main page, and will be delivered free of charge (if located within the Charlottesville and/or Albemarle areas).
